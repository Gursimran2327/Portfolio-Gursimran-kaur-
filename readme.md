#My Portfolio

Welcome to my website portfolio! This website highlights my work and abilities as a web developer.


## About:

This portfolio was created to highlight my web development expertise while also providing a platform for me to showcase my efforts to potential employers or clients.

## Process

### Planning.
I started by identifying the aims and objectives for my portfolio. I wanted it to be visually appealing, easy to navigate, and effective in highlighting my work and skills. I used wireframes and mockups to plan the layout and design.

## Development
I created the portfolio with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with some additional libraries and frameworks for certain functionality. I concentrated on building clean, maintainable code and optimizing performance to ensure a smooth user experience across many devices.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Responsive Design**: One of the biggest problems was making sure the portfolio looked attractive and worked well on different screen sizes. To create a responsive website, I used media queries and flexible layout strategies.
- **Performance Optimization**: To increase page load speeds and overall performance, I optimized pictures, minified CSS and JavaScript files, and used lazy loading for specific content.
- **Accessibility**: I wanted to make sure the portfolio was accessible to individuals with disabilities. I used standard practices for accessibility, such as using semantic HTML, providing alternative text for images, and ensuring keyboard.
